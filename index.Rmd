## Welcome!

My name is Jens and I am a marine biogeochemist, meaning I try to understand how organisms - including the two of us - shape their chemical environment, and vice versa. To do so, I enjoy wrangling, visualizing, synthesizing and thereby understanding measurements from autonomous observatories such as voluntary observing ships, floats and buoys. If the CO2 content of seawater is involved in one way or another, this makes me even more happy.

Want to know more? Come in and have a look!
