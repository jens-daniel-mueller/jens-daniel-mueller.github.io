## In brief

***

Hi there, I’m Jens – a biogeochemist exploring how the ocean takes up and stores carbon. My work combines global CO₂ measurements in seawater with data science and model simulations.

Since 2025, I have been a Research Fellow at the Carbon to Sea initiative, where I coordinate [OAEMIP](https://www.carbontosea.org/2025/03/20/oae-model-intercomparison-project/){target="_blank"} – the first global ocean alkalinity enhancement model intercomparison project – to assess the potential of ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR).

From 2020 to 2025, I was a Postdoc with Nicolas Gruber at ETH Zurich, where I tracked the [accumulation of CO~2~ in the global ocean](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023AV000875){target="_blank"}, and how this drives [acidification in the ocean interior](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado3103){target="_blank"}. During this time, I also documented an [unexpected decline of the ocean carbon sink in 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02380-4){target="_blank"} during a record-breaking global marine heatwave. I further coordinated [RECCAP2](https://reccap2-ocean.github.io/){target="_blank"}, bringing together over 100 scientists worldwide to better understand the changing ocean carbon sink.

Curious? Let’s dive deeper!
