## In brief

***

Hi there, my name is Jens and I'm a biogeochemist studying the ocean carbon cycle through measurements of CO~2~ in seawater. Since 2020, I'm working as a PostDoc with Nicolas Gruber at ETH Zurich. We use global ship-based observations to reconstruct the [accumulation of CO~2~ in the global ocean](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.167525217.76035050/v1), and how this drives acidification in the ocean interior. This work profits from the experience gained during my PhD, specifically the development of pH analytics, the analysis of autonomous pCO~2~ measurements from a voluntary observing ship and several months spent at sea. As a coordinator of [RECCAP2](https://reccap2-ocean.github.io/) - the second cycle of the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes project - I'm working with an international board of around 100 scientists covering a broad view on the ocean carbon sink through models and surface flux estimates.
